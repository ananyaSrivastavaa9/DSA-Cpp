Data Structures & Algorithms in C++
BTech CSE (AI & Machine Learning) | Beginner Friendly

Welcome to my DSA in C++ repository!
I am a BTech Computer Science Engineering (AI & Machine Learning) Student, and this repository documents my learning journey of Data Structures and Algorithms using C++ from scratch.
This repository is focused on building strong fundamentals, which are essential for AI/ML, competitive programming, internships, and placements.

Why DSA for AI & ML Students?

Even in AI & Machine Learning, DSA is very important because:
Efficient algorithms improve model performance
Data structures help manage large datasets
Strong DSA skills are required for interviews & coding rounds
Concepts like recursion, DP, graphs are used in ML internally
